\section{Convolutional network for feature extractor}
One of the architectures for the character recognition consist out of the feature extraction with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by a classification with the bidirectional Long Short Term Memory. The weights of the pre-trained CNN are from a network that is trained on large scale image dataset \cite{simonyan2014}. This network is called the VGG network by Simonyan \& Zisserman and in table \ref{Tab:convconf} is show the configuration that is used in this paper.
