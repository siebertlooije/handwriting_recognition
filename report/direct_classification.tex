\subsection{Word classification with character certainty}
For each crop generated by the character segmentation, the described architectures produce for each character an estimate of how likely it is that the crop depicts that character. These estimates are in the range $[0, 1]$. Characters for which the certainty is larger than $0.1$ are kept as possible crop classifications. When a word image is sliced with more than 50 cutting positions, only the most likely character option is kept for each crop to allow fast classification.

From the combinations of crops that can make op the word image, a list of likely word strings is generated. This is done by replacing each crop with all characters that were kept as possible classifications for that crop. The average of the certainties of the characters that make up a word is used as an estimation of the word likelihood. The word image is classified as the word string with the largest likelihood that occurs in the vocabulary. If none of the generated word strings occur in the vocabulary, word images are classified according to section \ref{sec:lanmod}
