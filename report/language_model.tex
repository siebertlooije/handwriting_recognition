\subsection{Language model}
After the classification of the different characters, the words are formed. The recognition system can have multiple words because the system can give different predictions for the same words. To resolve this issue a language model is often used in other classifications. In this classification task a closed vocabulary is given. In this language model is first checked which predicted words are in the vocabulary by using the bigrams,trigrams and the fourgrams of the predicted words with all the words in the vocabulary. In this way the first most strange words are filtered away. If then only one word is left, this is the predicted words but there are many cases where there are no words left or more then one word left.\\\\
The next step is that the Levenshtein distance is calculated for the words that are predicted and the words in the vocabulary. The distance measurement that are tried, are: the Sorenson, Jaccard, Hamming and the Levenshstein distance. The Levenshstein came up as best for this task. The idea of the Levenshstein distance is that it calculates after how many modification are need to go from one string to the other string.  Where every insertion and deletion of a character has a cost of 1 and a substitution has a cost of 2. So if the string that are compared are equal then the Levenshstein distance will be zero.  If there is one words with the Levenshstein distance that is zero or has the lowest Levenshstein distance then this will be the resulting word but if there are more results with the same Levenshstein distance then the next step is used.\\\\
The next step is to get the confidence of the neural network as factor. The word with the highest prediction confidence will be taken then, but because it is not controlled if this word is in the vocabulary it will first be checked and if there is one word left then this is the resulting word. If there are multiple words that are also in the vocabulary then the Levenshstein distance will also be calculated as before and the word with the highest word is taken as resulting word. As after all this steps there are still multiple words then the word with the highest prediction confidence will be taken. The whole language model is also show in figure \ref{Fig:languagemodel}.
